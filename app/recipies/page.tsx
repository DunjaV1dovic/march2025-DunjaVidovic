      <title>HOW TO MAKE A REFRESHING BOWL OF SALT</title>
      <p>Hello customer. Today I will be teaching you how to make the best dish in the world. Salt in a bowl</p>

      <p>Step 1: unlock your saltshaker by opening the lid. If that fails, cut it open like an absolute animal with the biggest steak knife you have in your house.</p>
      <p>Step 2: pour that delicious salt in a bowl and stick a spoon in it and eat! Enjoy! </p>

      <p>EXTRA STEPS: How to season your salt</p>
      <p>Now, I myself like my salt raw and unseasoned. But I completely understand if one wants to put extra flavour on it. My recommendation are sprinkes, specifically the dark ones. Because I can't see my salt with the light sprinkles.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy a little bit of honey every one and a then. I know, I like to live dangerously</p>
      <p>In order to seaon your salt, you need to repeat steps 1 and 2. Grab your choice of flavour, open the lid, and pour it in!</p>

      <p>"WHAT DO I DO IF MY SALT TOO POWDERY???"</p>
      <p>I hear this question all the time, poor people shaking their salt too hard that it crushes in their shaker and comes out as too powdery and bland. It is okay, for I have a solution for this.</p>
      <p>Continue crushing your salt, and you have to trust me on this. Crush it, (or blend it) until you have two full cups of powdery salt.</p>
      <p>nex tthing you want to do is grab your flour. I know that you all prefer beautiful organic salt on it's own, but flower is necessary for this step</p>
      <p>Add half a cup of flower to your two cups of salt. Next, add a cup of water. The salt will absorb the water and totally NOT get disintegrated by it. Mix your combination until you get a dough like structure. </p>
      <p>Once the dough is ready, jam that thang in the oven</p>
